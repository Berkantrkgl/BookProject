# BookProject
This project is a website created for people to share the books they like and read. 

## Description
The purpose of the project is to create a chance to practice my knowledge in the process of learning Nodejs. I used Ejs and Bootstrap for Frontend throughout the project. In addition, I sent a request to the Open Library API with Axios and pulled the book covers according to their ISBN number. I saved the entered data to the PostgreSql database.
